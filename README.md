The original game Rogue as it was released circa 1980, with a few modern features, written in Go using Tcell. The goal is to recreate the playing experience of the original game as much as possible.

Why?  To teach myself Go, to develop my own framework for future roguelike games, to limit my scope so I actually produce a playable game and, of course, to have a bit of fun.
